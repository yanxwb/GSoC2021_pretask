# GSoC2021_pretask

This project is a simple exercise for GSoC2021.

By compiling given files, we can achieve a simple function:

given a number, generating that number of random 3D points in a unit sphere,  building the corresponding 3D Delaunay Triangulation, extracting faces on the convex hull, creating a Surface_mesh out of them and writing it into "mesh.off".
